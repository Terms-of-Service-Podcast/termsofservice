        peer-to-peer and decentralised technologies that empower users and redefine

        Mary's educational background as a social scientist grounds the explorations 
        at intersection of sociality and technology, exposing the trade-offs in 
        privacy, security, and agency inherent in our digital choices. 
        On “Terms of Service,” she invites listeners to rethink these everyday 
        interactions and the broader implications of AI, distributed tech, 
        and legal frameworks on our digital lives, advocating for a future where 
        individuals have greater control over their data and decisions.
