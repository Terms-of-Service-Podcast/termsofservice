# About Us

Welcome to “Terms of Service,” the podcast that dives deep into the fine print of our digital lives. Every time we check the box on an app, website, or online service, we’re making choices—often without knowing the full story. From giving away our privacy to navigating complex security settings, we’re all part of a digital landscape that’s constantly evolving.

Join us as we unpack the themes that shape our online experiences: privacy, security, safety, and the everyday permissions we grant without a second thought. We’ll explore how AI, agency, and decentralized technologies are reshaping our digital world, often in ways that fly under the radar. And because no conversation about our digital lives would be complete without it, we’ll tackle the legal and policy implications that come with our clicks, swipes, and taps.

Whether you’re tech-savvy or just trying to keep up, “Terms of Service” invites you to join the conversation about the hidden costs of convenience in the digital age. Tune in to explore, question, and rethink the terms we often accept without a second thought, and let’s challenge the norms of our digital lives together.
